    Some small (and big) projects that I carry out in my spare time

sections:
  - title: Amusement Projects
    remarks:

        Small projects that are meant to test some ideas, or just to have fun
    list:
      - title: Artsy Fartsy

        remarks:

            SVG based drawing for souls that stopped drawing after they were 5.
      - title: Paper Chain
        href: /musings/paper-chain
        remarks:
          - |
            A project pioneered by Bossonica, which started as an attempt to 
            choose a single word everyday to add to "paper chain".
          - |
            However, it quickly grew into this Twitter-like feed. I'm not sure 
            why I post on this instead of Twitter itself.
      - title: Trucker Jokes
        subtitle: in Turkish
        href: /musings/kamyon
        remarks:
          - |
            A collaboration with Ennuriye in aim of gathering amusing and 
            insightful examples of what is colloquially called "trucker jokes" 
            in Turkey. 

  - title: Container Templates
    remarks:
      - |
        It's very rare that I develop anything outside of a container. This such
        a regular thing for me that until Devcontainers CLI came out, I didn't 
        have NodeJS installed on my development machine.
      - |
        The repos listed here build the environment for almost all the code I
        write. As a matter of principle are all CI&CD based, properly tested and
        documented.
    list:
      - title: C Containers
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/c-containers
        remarks: 
          - |
            Emscripten - Conan containers that I use for working on lower-level 
            concepts and some web-based graphical computing.
      - title: Ethereum Containers
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/ethereum-containers
        remarks: 
          - |
            While I do not think that Web3 will completely replace Web2,
            I do believe that it will hold a very important place in the world
            of tomorrow. I usually base my ethereum ecosystem related workshops
            on the containers created by this repo.
      - title: Node Containers
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/node-containers
        remarks:
          - |
            Usually the workhorse of my stack, Node containers this repo
            creates ends up being used in most of my personal CS projects.
      - title: PlantUML Containers
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/plantuml-containers
        remarks: 
          - |
            There is one thing linguists do that I like a lot: through the 
            virtue of their subject, they have to create very stringent definitions
            for the concepts that they have to work with. I see application and
            system design the same way. I use containers that are created by this
            repo to work on these aspects of my coding journey.
      - title: Python Containers
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/python-containers
        remarks: 
          - |
            Python is my language of choice for my non-CS based interests. While
            it's hard to choose a chief among them; currently this repo provides
            me containers for my economics, music and mathematics related 
            workshops.
      - title: React Native Containers
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/react-native-containers
        remarks:
          - |
            The newest addition to this list - These containers help me 
            work on prototyping work I do with React Native projects.

  - title: Repo Templates
    remarks: 
      - |
        I treat repos the way clusters treat containers: they are ephemeral to me.
      - |
        Some of my go-to templates are listed here. I usually think about how
        to improve these templates while I'm working on the workshops that are 
        based on them.
    list:
      - title: Conda Econ Repo Template
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/conda-econ-repo-template
        remarks: 
          - |
            Despite most of my life now revolving around coding, I'm actually
            an economics grad. Before my current life, I did do a lot based on 
            the wisdom I have gained through my education. This repo is usually
            the coding template counterpart of all the econ things I think about 
            and execute.
      - title: Conda Math Repo Template
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/conda-math-repo-template
        remarks:
          - |
            Since highschool, math has held a very important place in my mind I 
            was convinced that we live in a deterministic universe that could 
            securely be represented by mathematical arguments.
          - |
            As time passed and I learned more about GÃ¶del et al, my opinions 
            on the subject changed. But I still find comfort in the notion that
            we have tool that is unreasonably effective in explaining nature and
            itself. I wish to be close to it as much as my time allows.
          - | 
            This template repo is the basis for all my math journeys that 
            can be carried out with a computer.
      - title: Conda Music Repo Template
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/conda-music-repo-template
        remarks:
          - |
            I tried to make it as a musician earlier in my life. It ultimately
            failed because I was more concerned with technical and theoretical
            aspects of music rather than the theatrics or even the delivery.
          - |
            In my past I spent quite some time working on theoretical aspects
            of pitch, rhythm, composition, orchestration, whatever else you can
            think of that relates to music. I remember the day I found out about
            Bohlen-Pierce scale or Diana Deutsch's work.
          - |
            I use this repo template to work on my musical inquiries and 
            occasionally compose. 
      - title: Diagram Repo Template
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/diagram-repo-template
        remarks:
          - |
            I have a visual mind. Even with very abstract ideas such as 
            democracy, I have some kind of visual that is guiding my 
            thoughts. 
          - |
            Unsurprisingly, I have a very strong urge to represent my 
            processes and designs with easily parseable diagrams. This 
            template repo helps me improve myself on this aspect of my 
            work.
      - title: Emscripten Conan Repo Template
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/emscripten-conan-repo-template
        remarks:
          - |
            I got interested in lower-level CS concepts after I found out that
            despite the common wisdom that Solidity resembles Javascript, it is
            actually closer to C and C++ in thinking and the kinds of mess you 
            can create.
          - |
            This repo template came out of my interest in bundling my C++ work
            with web. I usually use this template for my C++ workshops.
      - title: Hardhat Repo Template
        href: https://www.github.com/utkusarioglu/hardhat-repo-template
        remarks:
          - |
            My Web3 work usually revolves around Hardhat - and increasingly
            Python related analysis tools such as Manticore, Echidna and 
            Slither. 
          - |
            Needless to say, the boilerplate that goes along with so many
            tools bundled up together is quite a hassle. This template repo
            helps me forget about all of that and work on my quest in
            trying to reestablish some kind of trust in society.
