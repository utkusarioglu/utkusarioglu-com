      My name is Utku. And yes, I do take photos quite regularly. But 
      photography has never been something I did professionally; except for a 
      year and a half when I decided to get into product photography. But I'll 
      come back to that later.

    content: |
      I studied economics in university. This wasn't enough for me though: I 
      was also a regular in courses that math, physics and musicology majors 
      took, worked for the music club as a classical guitar and music theory 
      instructor, and wrote for the economics club's magazine.

      I mention my time in university because it perfectly describes how I live. 
      I'm usually involved with multiple things concurrently. They generally 
      serve a common purpose but that may not be obvious for a novel observer. 
      This makes me think that maybe I should say that octopuses are my spirit
      animal the next time someone asks. With their multiple semi-independent 
      arms handling so many things at once...

      I followed a similar octopus-like variety in my leanings after university 
      as well: working in various companies and pursuing music as a musician and
      a teacher, studying topics ranging from math to cognitive science, from 
      anatomy to programming, and taking courses on marketing, advertising,
      social media management and others that I cannot even recall right 
      now.

    content: |
      Following topics to some kind of natural cadence is what I have to do to 
      rivet concepts in my head. If I have to cross discipline boundaries to 
      get there, I simply have to pursue that end.

      I have to admit that my thirst for knowledge has yielded some unexpected
      results. During the early years of my professional life, I was working at 
      a distributor for tech products. A part of my responsibilities involved 
      monitoring credits defined to various clients that pulled products from 
      us.

      I wasn't happy with the software that the company used for monitoring 
      thousands of clients, so I wrote something supplementary to it. What I 
      knew best at the time was Matlab. It was obvious that Matlab wasn't up 
      to that task so I learned a bunch of others as my code demanded. The 
      code I wrote was a hit and it was partially implemented into the main 
      software that the company used.

      The same thing kept happening as time passed. As another example, I was
      tasked as sort of a correspondence person in an oil refinery project. My
      task was mainly to be the glue between the foreign engineering company 
      and my own company's construction people and their contractors. I was 
      chosen for role because I already had an organic relationship with both 
      parties as the trade director that imported all the machinery that was 
      used in the project.

      Technical and financial arguments inevitably arose between teams and 
      departments, and I was usually there to witness the gridlocks emerging from  
      incompatible demands on time, space, and funds. My realization at that 
      point was that I actually understood the concerns of all parties. I studied 
      math and physics for years and that got me some way towards understanding 
      technical issues, I had years of experience with training students for 
      music and some other occasional subjects, which gave me the skills to 
      help people visualize issues, explain solutions and have them accept 
      them as their own ideas.

      As I interjected myself into these discussions, it became clear to 
      everyone that I was able to manage the project. It didn't take long 
      before I became the go-to person for conflict resolution and big-picture 
      things. This was customary at first, but later it became the norm through
      my newly assumed title as the project manager.

    content: |
      I can't say that I'm a big history buff but I do spend some of my time 
      reading about early civilizations. What I tend to focus on while reading 
      these are the lives of everyday people. The kinds of hardships that they 
      faced, what they would have thought of our modern world or its 
      inhabitants. I try to compare these with the zeitgeist.

  - type: paragraph
    content: |
      Most people I meet think that the world is going towards multiple 
      disasters, that the things are changing for the worse as time passes. I'm
      unable to feel that way. I see a lot of dangers, and responsive actions 
      taken much later than they ought to. But I can't help but believe that
      we will likely solve most of our problems - and in the process inevitably 
      create others.

      I find myself in a head space where I find a lot of uses for forced 
      immutability created through cryptography. The kind that is used in
      designs such as blockchain and transparency logs. I want to use these 
      ideas to build a base of trust for society.

      There are many moving pieces that need to come together and many cultural
      shifts we will have to take to get there. But we have done similar things
      in the past. If we can offer people working and intuitive solutions, 
      they will use them and rely on them. Maybe that reliance can be used for 
      good things from which we can all benefit.

    content: What about that photography thing?

  - type: paragraph

      That was one of times I didn't realize what I was getting myself into. 
      One of the gifts that my dad gave me during my childhood was the love of
      photography. I spent most of my childhood practicing landscape and macro 
      photography.

      When my company needed new photos of their updated product line, I saw
      this as a learning opportunity and jumped on it. The smart thing would 
      have been to let a seasoned photographer handle such a task. But I wanted 
      to learn. I thought that my years of experience would have counted for 
      something. Turns out, I was almost entirely wrongðŸ˜†

      I eventually figured my way around shooting with artificial lighting 
      and using Photoshop in a way that was beyond me at the time. I have to 
      mention that I got guidance from several people who worked in photography 
      and design during that time, which lead to flourishing friendships for 
      which that I'm grateful.

      I still occasionally come across billboards and websites that feature 
      some of the photos I have taken during that time. It's definitely one 
      of the coolest feelings to see your work put on a giant screen for 
      everyone to see.
