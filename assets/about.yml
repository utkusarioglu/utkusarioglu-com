      I'm an economist by degree but I have spent a considerable time studying 
      music, math, physics and programming. In addition to these primary 
      interests of mine, I have also been involved with photography, 
      advertising and marketing through the professional roles I have served.

      I tend to thrive under challenges I understand. It's a very common thing 
      for me to lose track of time while working on something I feel passionate 
      about. The downside of this is that I spend some of my days upset with 
      myself if I cannot get something to reach a state I'm satisfied with.

      I tend to rise to leadership positions in most of the teams I participate 
      in. I rarely intend for this to happen but I am usually level-headed and 
      open-minded in many situations while many others give in to frustrations 
      that are induced through exhaustion or stress. Heads usually end up 
      turning to me to guide the conversation or to resolve the gridlock.

      I want to help build a world where true information is readily available, 
      where there is trust in society through implementation of the right 
      carrots and the fewest sticks. I believe that we are on the cusp of many 
      great changes that can help realize these ideals.

      I spend my free time reading articles and watching videos about 
      prehistoric civilizations, art history, contemporary civilian and 
      military engineering projects. I also enjoy taking photos and processing 
      them. But most of all, my free time is devoted to music. I am an avid 
      classical music, jazz, rock and metal listener and performer.
