      My name is Utku and that's me in that photo above. Yup, I do take photos 
      quite regularly but it has never been something I did professionally - 
      except for a year and a half when I decided to get into product 
      photography. But I'll come back to that later.

      I studied economics in university. While doing that, I was regularly 
      attending courses that math, physics and musicology majors took. I was 
      and still am very involved in music. During that time I was also
      a guitar and music theory instructor for the music club and wrote for
      the economic's club magazine.

      I tend not to think too hard on questions like what I'd do on a deserted 
      island or what my spirit animal might be, but as I'm writing this, I'm 
      thinking that maybe an octopus could be a meaningful symbol as my spirit 
      animal; with its multiple arms reaching a number of things and working 
      semi-independently from each other.

      I followed a similar octopus-like variety in my leanings after university 
      as well. Working in various companies and pursuing music as a musician and
      a teacher, studying topics ranging from math to cognitive science, from 
      anatomy to computer science. Taking courses on marketing, advertising,
      social media management and some others that I cannot even recall right 
      now.

      Following topics to an endpoint that feels like natural cadence is what
      I have to do to rivet concepts in my head. If I have to cross discipline
      boundaries to get there, I simply do not mind.

    content: |
      I have to admit that my thirst for knowledge has yielded some unexpected
      results during my life. During the early years of my professional life, I
      was working at a distributor for tech products. A part of my 
      responsibilities involved monitoring credits defined to various clients
      that pulled products from us.

      I wasn't happy with the software that the company used for monitoring 
      thousands of companies, so I wrote my own. What I knew best at the time 
      was Matlab at the time and it wasn't up to the task so I learned a bunch 
      of others as the job required. But the fact that I already had a working
      knowledge of programming as an econ major worked wonders for my career
      during that time.

      The same thing kept happening as time passed. As another example, I was
      tasked as sort of a correspondence person in an oil refinery project. My
      task was mainly to be the glue between the engineering company from which
      I imported all the machinery, and my own company's construction people and 
      their contractors.

      Technical, financial arguments inevitably rose between teams and 
      departments, and I was usually there to witness the gridlocks of 
      incompatible demands on
      time, space, and funds. My realization at that point was that I actually
      understood the concerns of all teams. I studied math and physics for years 
      and that got me some way towards understanding technical issues, I had 
      years of experience with training students for music and some other 
      occasional subjects, which gave me the skills to help people visualize 
      issues, explain solutions and have them accept them as their own ideas.

      As I interjected myself into these discussions, it became clear to everyone that I was 
      able to manage a refinery project. It didn't take long before people 
      started to turn their heads to me in meetings when there was a conflict 
      to be resolved. This was customary at first and through my newly assumed
      title in the project later on.

      That was one of times I didn't realize what I was getting myself intoðŸ˜† 
      One of the gifts that my dad gave me during my childhood was the love of
      photography. I spent most of my childhood shooting photos of people and 
      landscapes.

      When my company needed new photos of their updated product line, I got 
      involved. The smart thing would have been to let a seasoned photographer
      handle such a task. But I wanted to learn. And I thought that my years of 
      experience would have counted for something. Turns out I was mostly wrongðŸ˜†

      I eventually figured my way around using artificial lights and using 
      Photoshop in a way that was beyond me at the time. I have to mention that
      I got guidance from some a few people who worked in photography and design
      during that time, which lead to florishing friendships that I'm grateful 
      for.

      I still occasionally see some of the photos I have taken on billboards
      and online ads. It's definitely one of the coolest feelings to see your
      work put on a giant screen for everyone to see.

      I'm sure you have been asked about what your spirit animal may be. I know 
      I have been asked that question plenty of times. I usually struggle with
      answering these sorts of questions but the more I think about it, the more
      I gravitate towards thinking that mine must be octopus.
  
  - type: paragraph
    content: |
      I say this because the multiple arms of an octopus reminds me of how my 
      life has been defined by me having my arms at multiple, and some times 
      unrelated, professional walks and interests at the same time.

      I studied economics in university while attending classes for mathematicians
      and physicists because what I was learning was helping me with my quest in
      understanding the nature of music. I was also one of the guitar instructors
      in music club and a contributor to the university's economics magazine.

    content: |
      After my graduation, I decided to pursue music while working in various
      companies related to my university degree. During my spare time I was 
      working on expanding my understanding of math, physics, cognitive and 
      computer science. I even remember studying anatomy and neuropsychology 
      during this time because their relation to psychology and cognitive 
      science.

      As time passed, my focus naturally shifted. Throughout my life, I ended 
      up studying advertising, marketing, social media management and product 
      photography; among other things. I thought the latter wouldn't be a huge
      jump over my already serviceable photography knowledge but I was dead 
      wrong. I eventually figured that one out as well. I have to admit 
      that seeing your photos on a giant billboard is very rewarding.

      As I walk through life, some ideas take deeper roots inside me. I have an

      I'm an economist by degree but I have spent a considerable time studying 
      music, math, physics and programming. In addition to these primary 
      interests of mine, I have also been involved with photography, 
      advertising and marketing through the professional roles I have served.

      I tend to thrive under challenges I understand. It's a very common thing 
      for me to lose track of time while working on something I feel passionate 
      about. The downside of this is that I spend some of my days upset with 
      myself if I cannot get something to reach a state I'm satisfied with.

      I tend to rise to leadership positions in most of the teams I participate 
      in. I rarely intend for this to happen but I am usually level-headed and 
      open-minded in many situations while many others give in to frustrations 
      that are induced through exhaustion or stress. Heads usually end up 
      turning to me to guide the conversation or to resolve the gridlock.

      I want to help build a world where true information is readily available, 
      where there is trust in society through implementation of the right 
      carrots and the fewest sticks. I believe that we are on the cusp of many 
      great changes that can help realize these ideals.

      I spend my free time reading articles and watching videos about 
      prehistoric civilizations, art history, contemporary civilian and 
      military engineering projects. I also enjoy taking photos and processing 
      them. But most of all, my free time is devoted to music. I am an avid 
      classical music, jazz, rock and metal listener and performer.
